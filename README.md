Analyze dice-roll systems, particularly those for Role-Playing Game character generation

Many RPG's use dice rolls to allocate character stat generation. Two example systems are:
* 4d6, sum the top 3
* 3d4 + 5

Which system do you choose? What do they look like, statistically? This simple set of code is designed to help answer that question.

Once you source the code in R, you can call any of the functions to either generate dice rolls or graph them.
